# **Sorting Algorithms**

Here, we have a collection of some classic sorting algorithms, each with accompanying explanations and complexity analyses.

1. **Bubble Sort**: A simple comparison-based sorting algorithm.
2. **Quick Sort**: A divide-and-conquer sorting algorithm.
3. **Merge Sort**: An efficient, stable sorting method.
4. **Insertion Sort**: A simple, adaptive sorting algorithm.
5. **Selection Sort**: An in-place comparison sorting algorithm.
6. **Heap Sort**: A comparison-based sorting algorithm using a binary heap.
7. **Radix Sort**: A non-comparative integer sorting algorithm.
8. **Shell Sort**: A generalized version of insertion sort.

## **Searching Algorithms**

This section provides a wide range of searching algorithms along with their unique characteristics, advantages, and disadvantages.

1. **Linear Search**: A simple method that scans elements sequentially.
2. **Binary Search**: A logarithmic search algorithm for sorted lists.
3. **Jump Search**: A square root based searching method for sorted lists.
4. **Interpolation Search**: A variant of binary search for uniformly distributed values.
5. **Hash Table Lookup**: An efficient way to search using hash tables.
6. **Binary Search Tree Lookup**: A tree-based search algorithm.
7. **B-Tree Search**: A self-balancing tree structure used in databases and file systems.
8. **Red-Black Tree Search**: A self-balancing binary search tree.
9. **Trie Search**: An ordered tree data structure used for string-based keys.
